Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
'''
#catch:array rotated numbers of times =index of minimum element in rotated array

class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        mini=nums[0]
        for i in range (1,len(nums)):
            mini=min(mini,nums[i])
        return(mini)
